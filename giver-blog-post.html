                <h1>The Giver</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The Giver is a story of a brilliant boy named Jonas who  
                    lives in a society that is being controlled by the rules and 
                    tradition of The Elders. Through his wisdom and mannerism, Jonas 
                    is selected as the Receiver of Memory, who is know as the giver. 
                    This post distinguishes him from others and gives him authority. 
                    He follows the rules and receives wisdom in the form of memories, 
                    but what he sees upsets him.

                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p class="text-preview">
                    The Giver was a riveting read that I'm certain I will reread on many 
                    occasions. So many moments in The Giver were so full of energy and life. 
                    While the Giver is a young adult book, it would definitely be enjoyed by 
                    all ages, with its beautiful descriptions. The simplicity and directness of 
                    Lois Lowry's writing gives the reader the chance to truly reflect on what they
                    read. The giver is a believabe and timeless novel, the I'm sure will be 
                    appreciated for years to come.

                    "Jonas," she said, dpeaking not to him alone but to the entire community of 
                    which he was a part, "you will be trained to be our nect Receiver of Memory. 
                    We thank you for your childhood."

                    Jonas's heart swelled with gratitude and pride. But at the smae time he was 
                    filled with fear. He did not know what his selection meant. He did not know what 
                    he was to become.

                    Or what would become of him.

                            Suhana currently attends Broadview Public School. Her favourite hobbys
                            include reading, coding and baking. She loves to build just about anything, whether
                            it's a website, or some overly complex dessert. Suhana is interested in math, coding 
                            and robotics and hopes to work in a field related to these topics.
